        5. Statement of Conversion
      </h3>
      <p className={`mt-3 text-[1.1rem]`}>
        All payments will be effected in Serbian currency – dinar (RSD). The
        amount your payment card account will be charged for is obtained through
        the conversion of the price in USD-RSD according to the
        current exchange rate of the Serbian National Bank. When charging your
        payment card, the same amount is converted into your local currency
        according to the exchange rate of payment card associations. As a result
        of this conversion there is a possibility of a slight difference from
        the original price stated in our web site.

        via public network in a protected (encrypted) form using SSL protocol
        and PKI system, as currently state-of-the-art cryptographic
        technologies. Data security during purchases is guaranteed by the
        payment card processor, Banca Intesa AD Belgrade, so the complete

        information is currently not available to our system.
